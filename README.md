# BattleShip Minigame
Battleship (also known as Battleships or Sea Battle) is a two-player strategy game **(in this case, you can play against an AI)**. The game is played on a set of grids on which each player's fleet of warships is marked. The location of the fleets is kept secret from the other player.
